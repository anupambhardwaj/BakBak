# BakBak
It is an Natural Language Processing(NLP) based chat application. The main purpose of this app will be to filter out any kind of inappropriate or aabusive content from being send to any other user.
# Motivation
Due to various incidents of mob lynching and very frequent forwards that we get on popular chat apps that are used to spread fake news and invoke people to do somthig that is unethical motivated me to develop this app, so that all this kind of incidents can be prevented from happening without affecting the privacy of other users.
# Build Status
This app is still in its development phase. 
# Tech/Framework Used
This application is build with Android Studio using JAVA as its main programing language and XML as its main UI language.
# Feature
The Natural Language Processing part of my app makes it stand out from the other chat applications. No other chat applications provides the filtering of message at the user end just before it is send. But with the help of NLP we can achieve this.
